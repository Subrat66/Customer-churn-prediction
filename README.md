Customer Churn Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a U.S. bank using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop accurate models that can identify customers likely to leave the bank, enabling proactive retention strategies.

Dataset
The dataset originates from a U.S. bank and contains various customer attributes, including credit score, geography, gender, and transaction history. The main target variable is 'Exited', indicating whether a customer churned (1) or not (0).

Data Preprocessing
Performed data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features to ensure uniformity in model input.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted EDA to uncover patterns and insights related to churn behavior. Used visualizations and statistical analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the data and its features.

Class Imbalance Handling
Addressed class imbalance by applying the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to ensure balanced representation of both churned and non-churned customers in the training data.

Model Selection and Evaluation
Explored multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, AdaBoost, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. Employed cross-validation to assess model performance robustness.

Results and Insights
Identified Random Forest and AdaBoost as top-performing models with balanced accuracy and meaningful precision-recall trade-offs. Analyzed feature importance to uncover factors contributing to churn, providing insights for targeted customer retention strategies.
